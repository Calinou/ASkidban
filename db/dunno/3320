in terms of\n                AS-set (preferred), AS number, route-set\n                (and the IRR database used to publish)\nremarks:        in fact we apply route filters based on this\n                for all neighbors - as far as feasible\nremarks:        for data published through the RIPE routing registry\n                we generate filters automatically\nremarks:        we consider the integration of RIR and routing registry data\n                and the application of RPSS authorization a great feature\n                of the RIPE routing registry\n                #  unfortunately this benefit is not available with any\n                #  other IRR database that we know of...\n                #  and some of the IRR databases allow essentially any garbage\n                #  to be registered without any control -
